# Raspberry Pi IoT Platform (Group Project)

## Description
A group project focused on researching and developing a new IoT platform using Raspberry Pi. The project covers the full software development process from start to finish (planning, design, implementation, testing, and documentation) and includes interaction with sensors and other related hardware components.

## Project Goals
- Research IoT requirements and suitable Raspberry Pi hardware/software stack
- Interface with sensors and hardware modules (data collection + device control)
- Build a working prototype demonstrating real-world IoT functionality
- Follow a complete SDLC workflow from initial requirements to final delivery

## Key Features (high level)
- Sensor reading and data processing on Raspberry Pi
- Hardware interaction (GPIO / connected components)
- Structured software development process: requirements, design, implementation, testing, and reporting
- Prototype demonstration of the platform concept

## Technologies (update as applicable)
- Raspberry Pi (Linux)
- Sensor modules (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion, light, etc.)
- Python or other language used for GPIO and device logic
- Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Team

- Aline Andrade Costa
